requirements of the laws of the State of Delaware (particularly Chapter
1, Title 8 of the Delaware Code and the acts amendatory thereof and

may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of

software distributed by the Corporation to the public at no charge.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the Board of Directors of the
Corporation elects to seek and obtains an exemption for the Corporation
from federal taxation pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended (the "IRC"), and until such time, if ever,
that such exemption is denied or lost, the Corporation shall not be

of the IRC as an organization described in Section 501(c) of the IRC.

No part of the net earnings of the Corporation shall inure to the
benefit of, or be distributable to, the Corporation's members,
directors or officers, or any other private person, except that the

compensation for services rendered and to make payments and
distributions in furtherance of the purposes herein set forth.

The Corporation shall be a membership corporation and shall not have
the authority to issue capital stock.  The conditions of membership

In the event of the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation (whether voluntary or by operation of
law), the Board of Directors of the Corporation will, after paying
or making any provision for the payment all liabilities of the
Corporation, distribute all of the assets of the Corporation as
it sees fit, consistent with the contractual obligations of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation is
exempt from federal taxation pursuant to Section 501(a) of the IRC at
the time of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation, then the Board of Directors shall make
such distribution(s) in such manner as the Board of Directors may
determine to the best suited to the accomplishment of the purposes
of the Corporation as set forth in Article 3 above and within the
intent of Section 501(c) of the IRC.

After the original or other Bylaws of the Corporation have been
adopted, amended or repealed, as the case may be, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 109 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws
of the Corporation may be exercised by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Bylaws
of the Corporation.

Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws
of the Corporation shall so provide.

To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to
the Corporation or its members for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director.

From time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other provisions
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force
may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed
by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the members
of the Corporation by this Certificate of Incorporation are granted
subject to the provisions of this Article 11.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned incorporator has hereunto set his
hand, declaring and certifying under penalties of perjury that the
foregoing instrument is his act and deed and that the facts stated
herein are true, this 25th day of March, 1999.
